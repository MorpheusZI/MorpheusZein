        Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is <span class="ems">Morpheus Zein Irawan</span> but
        you can call me <span class="em">Murphy</span>, I am a Junior
        <span class="ems">Full-stack</span> Web Developer. I am currently 17
        years old. I live in Cibinong, Bogor, West Java. I am currently studying
        at SMK Plus Pelita Nusantara majoring in Software Engineering class of
        XI RPL-2. And Now, I'm learning how to become the best Full stack
        developer.
      </p>
      <p class="abouts">
        My experience in software programming can be said to be a fun and useful
        experience, so I started my coding journey when i was in my 9th grade
        junior highscool, my dad tought me how to code, especially the
        fundementals, from then i learned by myself by joining code bootcamps or
        learn from the internet
      </p>
      <p class="abouts">
        I have now 2 years of coding experience and 1 of those years are full of
        web development,i believe web development is a very fun major to learn
        because it is the most powerfull thing you could learn from such a basic
        level, i could make websites, apps, and other things from this. i
        started with the usual, HTML,CSS,JS. my favorite is probably ReactJS,
        Ive been studying it from the start of this year and made a bunch of
        cool projects with it, And NextJS (its framework) is probably the best
        meta-framework ive used, made so many
        <a class="poj" href="skillz.html">projects</a> with it and had so much
        fun!
